## UpItUp 

This project implements a sliding puzzle game where you move an empty space to arrange the board such that all `1`s are on the top row. It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest sequence of moves to solve the puzzle. Moves include shifting the empty space up, down, left, or right.
## Rubik's Cube Solver

This project implements a solver for a 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube using Breadth-First Search (BFS). It simulates cube moves and finds the shortest sequence to solve the cube from any given configuration.
### Moves Explanation

- `R` - Rotate the right face clockwise
- `U` - Rotate the upper face clockwise
- `F` - Rotate the front face clockwise
- `Rp` - Rotate the right face counterclockwise
- `Up` - Rotate the upper face counterclockwise
- `Fp` - Rotate the front face counterclockwise
- `R2` - Rotate the right face 180 degrees
- `U2` - Rotate the upper face 180 degrees
- `F2` - Rotate the front face 180 degrees
