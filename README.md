## UpItUp 
This project implements a sliding puzzle game where you move an empty space to arrange the board such that all `1`s are on the top row. It uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest sequence of moves to solve the puzzle. Moves include shifting the empty space up, down, left, or right.
